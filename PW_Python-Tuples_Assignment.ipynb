    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",

    "my_tuple = tuple(\"Hello, world!\")\n",

    "#Q3. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?\n",
    "#Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "#In Python, tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items, but they have several key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Mutability:\n",
    "Tuple: Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "List: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements by changing, adding, or removing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Syntax:\n",
    "Tuple: Tuples are defined by enclosing comma-separated elements within parentheses ().\n",
    "List: Lists are defined by enclosing comma-separated elements within square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",
    "#Performance:\n",
    "Tuple: Tuples are generally faster than lists, especially for small collections, because they are simpler and more memory efficient.\n",
    "List: Lists are more flexible and offer more built-in methods and operations than tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Usage:\n",
    "Tuple: Tuples are typically used to store collections of items that should not be changed, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments.\n",
    "List: Lists are used when you need a collection of items that can be modified, such as maintaining a dynamic list of elements, sorting, or performing insertions and deletions."
